    <h2>Greetings to My Beloved Pilgrim Church Members!</h2>
  
  <p>Hello, my name is Hazel Kim. I am actively involved in the youth ministry at Philgrim Church and currently work as a teacher.</p>
  
    <p>I am so grateful to the church members who always warmly care for each individual. I hope that we can continue to be a community that treats one another with warmth, just as we have been doing. By showing more tolerance and kindness towards each other, we can become a church that brings even greater joy to God.</p>
