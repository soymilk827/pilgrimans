     Dear Pilgrim church,

  <p>
      Hello fellow Pilgrim church members, my name is Olivia and I'm 10 years old. I am currently in Daniel and in grade 5. I go to Lindfeid public school.

     I love our church afternoon activities, the food (somethimes)and the members. I suggest you to make different foods every week. This makes the people make eat more varities for food.</p>
