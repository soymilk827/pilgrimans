       Hello fellow Pilgrim church members, my name is Olivia and I'm 10 years old. I am currently in Daniel and in grade 5. I go to Lindfeid public school.
   </p>
   <p>
      I love our church afternoon activities, the food (somethimes)and the members. I suggest you to make different foods every week. This makes the people make eat more varities for food.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Isaac. I go to LIndfield public school and im turning 10 years old. Im in Daniel.</p>
<p>Our people in the church are very kind to eachother. The food are delicious adn our teachers work very hard. However, I do think it would be better if we ate different meals each week. Also, I think we can keep the toilets a little cleaner.</p>
