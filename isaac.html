  <h1>Dear Pilgrim Church</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Isaac. I go to LIndfield public school and im turning 10 years old. Im in Daniel.</p>
<p>Our people in the church are very kind to eachother. The food are delicious adn our teachers work very hard. However, I do think it would be better if we ate different meals each week. Also, I think we can keep the toilets a little cleaner.</p>
